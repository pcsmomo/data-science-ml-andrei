### 10. Types of Machine Learning

- Supervicsed
  - classification
  - regression
- Unsupervices
  - clustering
  - assiciation rule learning
- Reinforcement
  - skill acquisition
  - real time learning

## Section 3: Machine Learning and Data Science Framework

## 16. Introducing Our Framework

1. Create a framework
2. Match to data science and machine learning tools
3. Learn by doing

### 17. 6 Step Machine Learning Framework

[A 6 Step Field Guide for Building Machine Learning Projects](https://www.mrdbourke.com/a-6-step-field-guide-for-building-machine-learning-projects/)

1. Data collection
2. Data modelling
   1. Problem definition
   - What problem are we trying to solve?
   2. Data
   - What data do we have?
   3. Evaluation
   - What defines success
   4. Features
   - What features should we model?
   5. Modelling
   - What kind of model should we use?
   6. Experimentation
   - What have we tried / what else ca we try?
3. Deployment

### 18. Types of Machine Learning Problems

- Supervised learning: "I know my inputs and outputs"
  - classification
    - binary classification: two options
    - multi-class classification: more than two options
  - refression
    - predict numbers
- Unsupervised learning: "I'm not sure of the outputs but I have inputs"
  - cluster
- Transfer learning: "I think my problem may be similar to something else"
- Reinforcement learning
  - real-time learning: e.g Alphago

#### When shouldn't you use machine learning?

- Will a simple hand-coded instruction based system work?

### 19. Types of Data

#### Structured/Unstructured

- Structured
  - excel, csv, etc.
- Unstructured
  - images?

#### dd

- Static
  - csv
- Streaming

### 20. Types of Evaluation

| Classification | Regression                     | Recommendation |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Accuracy       | Mean Absolute Error (MAE)      | Precision at K |
| Precision      | Mean Squared Error (MSE)       |                |
| Recall         | Root mean squared error (RMSE) |                |

### 21. Features In Data

- Numerical features
- Categorical features

Feature engineering: Looking at different features of data and creating new ones/altering existing ones

#### What features should you use?

Feature Coverage: How many samples have different features? Ideally, every sample has the same featuers
